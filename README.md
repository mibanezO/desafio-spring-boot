# Swagger generated server

Spring Boot Server Nuevo SPA


## Overview  
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core), you can easily generate a server stub.  
This is an example of building a swagger-enabled server in Java using the SpringBoot framework.

The underlying library integrating swagger to SpringBoot is [springdoc-openapi](https://github.com/springdoc/springdoc-openapi)

Make sure you are using java 17 to run this application

Start your server as a simple java application providing this environment variables:

```yaml
JWT_SECRET        # The secret used to generate the JWT.
JWT_EXPIRATION    # The expiration number in hours.
```

Two scripts are provided to run the application:

[run.bat](scripts%2Frun.bat)
[run.sh](scripts%2Frun.sh)

Both contain the variables and the command to run the application with maven

The preloaded database will be created in the root of the project inside the `data` directory. 

You can view the api documentation in swagger-ui by pointing to  
http://localhost:8080/api/v1  

Change default port value in application.properties

A postman collection can be found in the directory postman:
- [Entorno.postman_environment.json](postman%2FEntorno.postman_environment.json)
- [Nuevo SPA.postman_collection.json](postman%2FNuevo%20SPA.postman_collection.json)

The first one is and environment that will load some variables for the collection to work properly
The second file is the collection itself.
